Practice Repo for Kai and Melissa

Hi Melissa, it's Kai and today we're practicing pushing and pulling for git hub! 
Are you ready?
Yes. Are you? 
How are you?
im good, how are you?
im good too. hows your break?

I wrote us a story

I would like to tell a story
about two people who learned how to 
install and use r and git hub
no one taught them about it,
they had to teach themselves!
nevertheless, they learned how to use github
earning lots of knowledge.
vezard and kaholoaa did great
even better than logan.. sike!
real scientists know that logan is 
someone you can't beat!
even if you've been in the field for ages
even if your some kind of prodigy
no one can beat her lol!
though you can try!
wonderful are melissa and kai
obviously such great researchers
pretty much the best 
researchers the campus has
ever seen! 
though sometimes
they struggle...
yes... they do
but they are also amazing
especially as caroline as their mentor!
some say shes 
the absolute best..
from my opinion, I think she is!
really!
interesting though, 
even caroline likes to go camping
night diving, going for long
drives down to big sur
so, we love caroline so much!

If you figured it out imma laugh lmaooo

road work ahead...
uhhhh yeah I sure hope it doessss

hey im lesbian...
